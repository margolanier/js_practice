			<p>However, she mistook the drowsy eye alcohol warning for a winking eye alcohol suggestion. Did Ted make an appointment? No. Well then Ted can GET THE HELL OUT OF THIS OFFICE! YOU GET THE HELL OUT! Quicken! Premiere! Sister's my new mother, Mother. And is it just me or is she looking hotter? Do the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society. Do you have any idea how often you say the word afraid? Well, I know I used it in the Jacuzzi.</p>

			<p>There are dozens of us! Dozens! Heyyyy Uncle Father Oscar. Now, do you wanna steer, or are you too old to sit on your Pop's lap and drive? With spicy club sauce. He's going to be all right.</p>

			<p>If I make this comeback, I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! Way to plant, Ann! If that man's straight, then I am sober.</p>

			<p>Never once touched my per diem. I'd go to Craft Service, get some raw veggies, bacon, Cup-A-Soup…baby, I got a stew goin'. No, I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being WITH you. How am I supposed to find someone willing to go into that musty old claptrap? The only thing I found in the fridge was a dead dove in a bag. Gob: You didn't eat that, did you? The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call… Heyyyyy campers!</p>

			<p>But anyhoo, can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood? Let's see some bananas and nuts! I am going to my spin class. I thought you had vertigo. Are you sure this isn't her sister? Mrs Veal: What a lovely thing to say. Michael: That's an awful thing to say. You mean the guy we're meeting with can't even grow his own hair? Come on! This was a big get for God. Actually, that was a box of Oscar's legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed.</p>

			<p>What about macaroni – let me finish – salad? Oh please. They didn't sneak into this country to be your friends.</p>
